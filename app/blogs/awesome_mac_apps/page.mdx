## Maccy

[Maccy](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy) is a lightweight clipboard manager for macOS. It keeps the history of what you copy and lets you quickly navigate, search, and use previous clipboard contents.

Project site: https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy.

Features:

- Open source and free
- Keyboard-first
- Lightweight and fast
- Secure and private
- Options to `past automatically` and `paste without formatting`
- It can ignore applications like password managers

## Hammerspoon

It is an open source tool for powerful automation of OS X. You can write Lua scripts to control many aspects of your OS X environment.

I mainly use it to configure global shortcuts for applications ([my config](https://github.com/nkcoder/dotfiles/tree/main/.hammerspoon)).

## Vim

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient.

I use Vim whenever possible, for example: VS Code (Cursor), Sublime Text, Intellij Idea etc ([my config](https://github.com/nkcoder/dotfiles/blob/main/.vimrc)).

## Rectangle

Move and resize windows in macOS using keyboard shortcuts or snap areas.

If you have a big screen, this app is very helpful and easy to divide the screen into different parts. Most used shortcuts:

- Left Half/Right Half
- Top Half/Bottom Half

- Top Left/Top Right
- Bottom Left/Bottom Right
