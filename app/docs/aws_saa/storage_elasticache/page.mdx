## ElastiCache

- AWS managed Redis/Memcached
- in-memory cache for read intensive applications
- might require heavy application change
- redis:
  - multi AZ for auto failover
  - read replicas to scale reads and have high availability
  - data durability using AOF persistency
  - backup and restore
  - supports sets and sorted sets
- memcached
  - multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding)
  - no high availability (replication)
  - no persistent
  - no backup or restore

- security
  - IAM authentication for Redis
  - Redis AUTH
  - security groups
  - IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for API-level security
  - Memcached supports SASL-based authentication

## Authenticating with AUTH command

- Using **Redis** **AUTH** command can improve data security by requiring the user to enter a password before they are granted permission to execute Redis commands on a password-protected Redis server.
- AUTH can only be enabled for encryption in-transit enabled ElastiCache clusters
    - so two parameters `--transit-encryption-enabled` and `--auth-token` are required
