# AWS EventBridge

- A serverless service that uses events to connect application components together, making it easier for developers to build scalable event-driven applications.

## Event buses

- Receive events from a variety of sources and match them to rules in your account.
- Different types of event buses receive events from different sources, including AWS services in your account and other accounts, custom applications and services, and partner applications and services.
- Enabling event discovery on an event bus will generate EventBridge Schemas for events on that bus.

## Rules

- A rule watches for specific types of events.
- When a matching event occurs, the event is routed to the targets associated with the rule.
- A rule can be associated with one or more targets.
- Event pattern:
  - Event source:
    - AWS services: S3, API Gateway, Auto Scaling, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, CloudFront, DynamoDB, ECR, ECS, Route53, SQS, SNS, SES etc.
    - EventBridge partners: Adobe, Auth0, Buildkite, PagerDuty, Zendesk etc.
  - Target:
    - API Gateway, ECS task, CodePipeline, SQS, SNS, Lambda, Batch etc.

## Scheduler

- A serverless scheduler that allows you to create, run, and manage tasks from one central, managed service.
- Highly scalable, EventBridge Scheduler allows you to schedule millions of tasks that can invoke any AWS service as a target.
- You can define one-time schedule, or recurring schedule
- Target: SNS, SQS, ECS, CodePipeline, API Gateway, EC2, ELB, Batch, Backup, CloudFront, CloudFormation, DynamoDB, etc.
