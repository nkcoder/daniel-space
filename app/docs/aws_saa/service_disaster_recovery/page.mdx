# Disaster recovery and migrations

## RPO and RTO

- RPO: Recovery Point Objective
  - the maximum acceptable gap between the data in the disaster recovery site and the latest data stored in the application when the disaster strikes
  - between the disaster and RPO is the data loss
  - for example: backup every hour
- RTO: Recovery Time Objective
  - the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of the application and the restoration of the service
  - this objective determines the acceptable time window for an application to be unavailable
  - between the disaster and RTO is the downtime

## Disaster Recovery Strategies

- backup and restore:
  - high RPO and high RTO
- pilot light:
  - a small version of the app (critical core) is always running in the cloud
  - very similar to backup and restore, but faster
  - lower RPO and lower RTO
- warm standby
  - full system is up and running, but at minimal size
  - upon disaster, scale to production load
  - low RPO and low RTO
- multi size / hot site approach
  - full production scale is running on AWS and on premise
  - very low RTO, but also very expensive

## Disaster Recovery tips

- backup
  - EBS snapshots, RDS automated backups/snapshots
  - regular pushes to S3 / S3 IA / Glacier, lifecycle policy, cross region replication
  - from on-premise: snowball, storage gateway
- replication
  - RDS replication (cross region), AWS Aurora + global database
  - database migration from on-premise to RDS
  - storage gateway
- high availability
  - route 53: migrate DNS over from region to region
  - RDS/ElastiCache: multi-AZ
  - site-to-site VPN as a recovery from Direct Connect
- automation
  - CloudFormation/Elastic Beanstalk to re-create a whole new environment
  - recover/reboot EC2 instances with CloudWatch if alarms fail

## Data Migration Service

- on-premise => AWS, AWS => on-premise, AWS => AWS
- CDC: Change Data Capture
- need to create an EC2 instance to perform the replication tasks
  - serverless replication: supports only a limited number of source and target endpoint engine type
- SCT: Schema Conversion Tool
  - used to convert database schema from one engine to another
