    - any runtime as long as it's packaged as a docker image
    - rely on EBS/instance store for disk space
    - relies on EC2 (ECS)

## Amazon Rekognition

Amazon Rekognition is a cloud-based image and video analysis service that makes it easy to add advanced computer vision capabilities to your applications.

- it can search, verify, and organize millions of images and videos
- you can proactively detect inappropriate, unwanted or offensive content

- related services:
  - Amazon SageMaker: it is a fully managed machine learning service, you can prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality ML models efficiently.

## Amazon SWF (Simple Workflow Service)

- provides a way to build, run and scale background jobs that have parallel or sequential steps
- you can coordinate work across distributed components, tracking the state of tasks (which can run either on AWS, or on-premises)

- Services that can be used to create a decoupled architecture for applications that use both AWS and on-premise resources?
  - Amazon SWF (Simple Workflow)
  - SQS/SNS
  - ELB (in the target group, the `IP Address` target type supports load balancing to VPC and on-premises resources)

## Amazon EMR

- EMR: Elastic Map Reduce
- a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark on AWS to process and analyze vast amount of data
- It securely and reliably handles a broad set of big data use cases, including log analysis, web indexing, data transformations (ETL), machine learning, financial analysis, scientific simulation and bioinformatics.

## Amazon Redshift

- It is the most widely used cloud data warehouse
- a fast, simple and cost-effective way to analyze the data using standard SQL and existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools
- allows you to run complex analytic queries against terabytes to petabytes of structured and semi-structured data, using sophisticated query optimization, columnar storage on high-performance storage and massively parallel query execution.

- Redshift Spectrum: Using Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can efficiently query and retrieve structured and semistructured data from files in Amazon **S3** without having to load the data into Amazon Redshift tables.

## Storage Gateway

AWS Storage Gateway gives your applications on-premises and in-cloud access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. You can deploy it as a Virtual Machine (VM) within VMware, Hyper-V or as an EC2 instance within VPC.

Storage Gateway types:

- File Gateway
- Amazon FSx File Gateway
- Tape Gateway
- Volume Gateway

For example, you can use a Tape Gateway to replace physical tapes on-premises with virtual tapes in AWS without changing existing backup workflows

## AWS Glue

- A serverless data integration service that makes it easy for analytics users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources.
- With AWS Glue, you can discover and connect to more than 70 diverse data sources and manage your data in a centralized data catalog.
- You can visually create, run, and monitor extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines to load data into your data lakes
- You can immediately search and query cataloged data using Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.
- Features:
  - Discover and organize data
  - Transform, prepare, and clean data for analysis
  - Build and monitor data pipelines

- **Job bookmarks**:
  - AWS Glue tracks data that has already been processed during a previous run of an ETL job by persisting state information from the job run. This persisted state information is called a job bookmark.
  - Job bookmarks help AWS Glue maintain state information and prevent the reprocessing of old data. With job bookmarks, you can process new data when rerunning on a scheduled interval.
  - A job bookmark is composed of the states for various elements of jobs, such as sources, transformations, and targets. For example, your ETL job might read new partitions in an Amazon S3 file. AWS Glue tracks which partitions the job has processed successfully to prevent duplicate processing and duplicate data in the job's target data store.

## Amazon Transcribe

Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition service that uses machine learning models to convert audio to text(audio => text).

You can use Amazon Transcribe as a standalone transcription service or to add speech-to-text capabilities to any application.

You can transcribe media in real time (streaming) or you can transcribe media files located in an Amazon S3 bucket (batch).

## Amazon Translate

Amazon Translate is a neural machine translation service for translating text to and from English across a breadth of supported languages (language translation).

**Use cases**

- Enable multilingual user experiences in your applications by integrating Amazon Translate
- Process and manage your company's incoming data (such as social media and news feeds in many languages)
- Enable language-independent processing by integrating Amazon Translate with other AWS services, for example:
  - extract from unstructured text such as social media streams with Amazon Comprehend
  - make subtitles and live captioning available with Amazon Transcribe
  - speak translated content with Amazon Polly

## Amazon Comprehend

Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights about the content of documents (document => topics).

**Examples**:

## Amazon Kendra

Amazon Kendra is an **intelligent search service** that uses natural language processing and advanced machine learning algorithms to return specific answers to search questions from your data.

Unlike traditional keyword-based search, Amazon Kendra uses its semantic and contextual understanding capabilities to decide whether a document is relevant to a search query. It returns specific answers to questions, giving users an experience that's close to interacting with a human expert.

## Amazon Detective

Amazon Detective makes it easy to analyze, investigate, and quickly identify the root cause of security findings or suspicious activities.

Detective automatically collects log data from your AWS resources and uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to help you visualize and conduct faster and more efficient security investigations.

- It is a highly automated lift-and-shift (rehost) solution that simplifies, expedites, and reduces the cost of migrating applications to AWS.
- It allows companies to lift-and-shift a large number of physical, virtual, or cloud servers without compatibility issues, performance disruption, or long cutover windows.
- The process:
  - Install AWS Replication Agent on your source servers. No reboot required.
  - Application Migration Service automatically replicates entire servers, including operating system, applications, data, and configurations.
  - Use the Application Migration Service console to perform non-disruptive tests in AWS prior to initiating a cutover.
  - When you are ready, use the Application Migration Service console to execute a successful cutover. Your servers are launched on AWS within minutes.
- Use case:
  - Data center to cloud migration: move your virtual and physical servers to AWS
  - Cross-cloud migration: migrate workloads running on another public or private cloud to AWS
  - Cross-region migration: migration between AWS accounts, availability zones, or regions

## AWS Migration Hub

- AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) provides a single place to discover your existing servers, plan migrations, and track the status of each application migration.
- You can visualize the connections and the status of the servers and databases that make up each of the applications you are migrating, regardless of which migration tool you are using.
- Migration Hub gives you the choice to start migrating right away and group servers while migration is underway, or to first discover servers and then group them into applications. Either way, you can migrate each server in an application and track progress from each tool in the AWS Migration Hub.
- It supports migration status updates from:
  - Application Migration Service
  - Database Migration Service
