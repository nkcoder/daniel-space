# AWS Storage Gateway

## S3 File Gateway

- A S3 File Gateway simplifies file storage in Amazon S3, integrates to existing applications through industry-standard file system protocols, and provides a cost-effective alternative to on-premises storage.
- Â It also provides low-latency access to data through transparent local caching. A S3 File Gateway manages data transfer to and from AWS, buffers applications from network congestion, optimises and streams data in parallel, and manages bandwidth consumption.
- You can store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using file protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB).
- You deploy the gateway into your on-premises environment as a virtual machine (VM)
- The gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files or file share mount points
- With the S3 File Gateway, you can do:
  - You can store and retrieve files directly using the NFS version 3 or 4.1 protocol.
  - You can store and retrieve files directly using the SMB file system version, 2 and 3 protocol.
  - You can access your data directly in Amazon S3 from any AWS Cloud application or service.
  - You can manage your S3 data using lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and versioning. You can think of a S3 File Gateway as a file system mount on Amazon S3.
