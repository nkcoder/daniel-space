## AWS Directory Service

- AWS Managed Microsoft AD
    - makes it easy to set up and run directories in the AWS cloud, or connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory
    - manage users and groups
    - provide single sign-on to applications and services
    - simplify the deployment and management of cloud-based Linux and Microsoft Windows workloads
    - securely connect to Amazon EC2 Linux and Windows instances
- AD Connector
    -  a directory gateway with which you can redirect directory requests to your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory without caching any information in the cloud
    - your end users and IT administrators can use their existing corporate credentials to log on to AWS applications such as WorkSpaces, Amazon WorkDocs, or Amazon WorkMail.
    - You can manage AWS resources like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon S3 buckets through IAM role-based access to the AWS Management Console.
    - You can consistently enforce existing security policies (such as password expiration, password history, and account lockouts) whether users or IT administrators are accessing resources in your on-premises infrastructure or in the AWS Cloud.
    - You can use AD Connector to enable multi-factor authentication by integrating with your existing RADIUS-based MFA infrastructure to provide an additional layer of security when users access AWS applications.
- Simple AD
    - a standalone managed directory that is powered by a Samba 4 Active Directory Compatible Server
    - provides a **subset** of the features offered by AWS Managed Microsoft AD, including the ability to manage user accounts and group memberships, create and apply group policies, and securely connect to Amazon EC2 instances
    - Simple AD makes it easier to manage amazon EC2 instances running Linux and Windows and deploy Windows applications in the AWS Cloud.
    - Many of the applications and tools that you use today that require Microsoft Active Directory support can be used with Simple AD.
    - User accounts in Simple AD allow access to AWS applications such as WorkSpaces, Amazon WorkDocs, or Amazon WorkMail.
    - You can manage AWS resources through IAM role–based access to the AWS Management Console.
    - Daily automated snapshots enable point-in-time recovery.
