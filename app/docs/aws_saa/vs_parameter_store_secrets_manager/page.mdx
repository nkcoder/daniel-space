# Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager

## Overview of Services

a. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Parameter Store is a component of AWS Systems Manager that provides a centralized store to manage configuration data and secrets. It allows you to store data as plain text or encrypted data.

b. AWS Secrets Manager

Secrets Manager is a dedicated service designed specifically for managing, retrieving, and rotating secrets such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.

## Typical Use Cases

a. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

- Configuration Management: Store non-sensitive configuration data like application settings, feature flags, URLs, and resource identifiers.
- Simple Secrets Management: Handle basic secrets (_SecureString_) that do not require advanced features like automatic rotation.
- Infrastructure as Code: Integrate with tools like AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, and others to manage configuration parameters.
- Hierarchical Storage: Organize parameters in a hierarchical structure for better management and access control.

b. AWS Secrets Manager

- Sensitive Data Management: Store and manage sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.
- Automatic Rotation: Automatically rotate secrets on a schedule or in response to events, supporting built-in integrations for databases and other services.
- Fine-Grained Access Control: Implement more granular access policies and audit trails for secret access and usage.
- Cross-Account Access: Share secrets securely across different AWS accounts.

## Choosing Between Parameter Store and Secrets Manager

When deciding between Parameter Store and Secrets Manager, consider the nature of the data you need to store and the required features:

- Use Parameter Store If:
  - You're storing non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., DB hostnames, environment settings, feature flags).
  - You require a centralized configuration management solution without the need for automatic rotation.
  - You want to minimize costs, especially when managing a large number of parameters.
- Use Secrets Manager If:
  - You're handling sensitive information that requires robust security measures (e.g., database passwords, API keys).
  - You need automatic rotation of secrets to enhance security.
  - You require fine-grained access control and audit capabilities for secret access.
  - You benefit from built-in integrations for secret rotation with supported services.

## Cost Considerations

- Parameter Store:
  - Standard Parameters: Free up to 10,000 API interactions per month.
  - Advanced Parameters: Billed based on the number of parameters and API interactions.
- Secrets Manager:
  - Charged based on the number of secrets stored and API requests made.
  - Additional Costs: Automatic rotation may incur additional Lambda charges.

Recommendation: Use Parameter Store for non-sensitive and less frequently accessed data to minimize costs, and reserve Secrets Manager for critical, sensitive information that benefits from its advanced features.

## Security Best Practices

- Encryption: Always encrypt sensitive data at rest. Both Parameter Store and Secrets Manager support AWS KMS for encryption.
- Access Control: Implement the principle of least privilege using IAM policies to restrict who or what can access specific parameters or secrets.
- Audit and Monitoring: Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor access and changes to your parameters and secrets for auditing purposes.
- Regular Rotation: For sensitive data, especially secrets, implement regular rotation to minimize the risk of compromised credentials.
