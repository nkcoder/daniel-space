## AWS ECS

Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. As a fully managed service, Amazon ECS comes with AWS configuration and operational best practices built-in.

## AWS Fargate

AWS Fargate is to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances.

- you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers.
- each Fargate task has its own isolation boundary and does not share the underlying kernel, CPU resources, memory resources, or elastic network interface with another task.
- your ECS service on AWS Fargate can optionally be configured to use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic evenly across the tasks in your service.

Fargate task ephemeral storage:

- by default, Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate receive a minimum of 20 GiB of ephemeral storage.
- the total amount of ephemeral storage can be increased up to a maximum of 200 GiB. You can do this by specifying the `ephemeralStorage` parameter in your task definition.
- the ephemeral storage is encrypted with an AES-256 encryption algorithm, which uses an AWS owned encryption key
