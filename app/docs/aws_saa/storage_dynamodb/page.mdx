## Global tables

Amazon DynamoDB global tables are a fully managed, multi-Region, and multi-active database option that delivers fast and localized read and write performance for massively scaled global applications.

- replicate your DynamoDB tables automatically across your regions
- eliminate the difficult work of replicating data between regions and resolve update conflicts
- ideal for massively scaled applications with globally dispersed users

## Capacity mode

- **Provisioned**: manage and optimise your costs by allocating read/write capacity in advance
  - auto scaling:
    - dynamically adjusts provisioned throughput capacity on your behalf in response to actual traffic patterns
    - you specify the minimum and maximum capacity units and target utilisation
- **On-demand**: Simplify billing by paying for the actual reads and writes your application performs

## Backup

- PITR (Point-in-time recovery)
  - provides continuous backups of your DynamoDB data for 35 days to help protect against accidental write or delete operations
  - provides up to 35 days of recovery points at a per second granularity
- On demand backups
  - creates full backup of your table
  - cannot be copied to a different region or account

- Scheduled backups (AWS Backup)
  - makes it easy to centralise and automate data protection across AWS services, in the cloud and on premises
  - policy-base backup: you can create backup policies (backup plans) to define your backup requirements and then apply to the AWS resources
  - cross-account/cross-region backup: yoau can copy backups to different AWS regions/accounts on demand automatically as part of the backup plan

## DynamoDB Accelerator

- Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available caching service built for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX delivers up to a 10 times performance improvement—from milliseconds to microseconds—even at millions of requests per second.
- DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management.
- As DAX is compatible with existing DynamoDB API calls, no application logic modification is required.
