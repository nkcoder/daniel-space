## SNS subscriptions

- When you create a new subscription for a SNS topic, you can specify:
    - Subscription filter policy
        - filters the messages that a subscriber receives based on message attributes and message body
        - Sample use case: you can create one SNS topic, and multiple SQS queues subscribed to the topic, set the filter policies in the SNS subscription to publish messages to designated SQS queue
    - Redrive policy (dead letter queue)
        - send undelivered messages to a dead letter queue
- Subscription protocols
    - Standard topic: 
        - SQS
        - AWS Lambda
        - SMS
        - Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
        - Email / Email-JSON
        - HTTP/HTTPS
        - Platform application Endpoint
    - FIFO topic:
        - SQS (standard queue or FIFO queue)
            - Strict message ordering and deduplication are guaranteed only when delivering to SQS FIFO queues.
