title: AWS EKS
description: Overview of Amazon EKS, its architecture, and how it integrates with other AWS services for running Kubernetes clusters.

At its core, Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easier to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Think of it as AWS taking care of the complex "plumbing" of Kubernetes while you focus on running your applications.

## The Control Plane

Amazon EKS automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane nodes that are responsible for scheduling containers, managing application availability, storing cluster data, and other key orchestration tasks. It runs the control plane across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability. This means if one zone fails, your cluster remains operational.

## Worker Node Management

For the worker nodes (where your applications actually run), EKS provides several options. You can use:

1. Amazon EC2 instances that you manage yourself
2. AWS Fargate for serverless container deployment
3. Amazon EC2 Spot Instances for cost optimization

## Integration with AWS Services

One of EKS's strongest features is its deep integration with other AWS services. For example:

- It works seamlessly with AWS IAM for authentication and authorization
- It integrates with Amazon VPC for networking
- It connects with AWS Load Balancers for traffic distribution
- It works with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging
- It supports AWS CloudTrail for audit logging

## Security Features

Security is built into EKS at multiple levels. The service automatically:

- Patches the Kubernetes control plane for security vulnerabilities
- Provides encrypted communication between the control plane and worker nodes
- Integrates with AWS KMS for secrets encryption
  - Enabling `Secrest encryption` allow you to AWS KMS keys to provide envelope encryption of Kubernetes secrets stored in **etcd** for your cluster. (not using Secrets Manager for credentials)
- Supports pod security policies and network policies

## Networking Capabilities

EKS offers sophisticated networking features through the Amazon VPC CNI plugin. This enables:

- Native VPC networking for pods
- Security group support at the pod level
- Support for different networking modes including IPv4 and IPv6
- Custom networking configurations for complex requirements

## Scaling and Updates

The service handles scaling and updates intelligently:

- Automatic scaling of the control plane based on demand
- Support for Cluster Autoscaler for worker node scaling
- Managed node groups for automated updates and patching
- Rolling updates with zero downtime for both control plane and worker nodes

Let's consider a practical scenario: Imagine you're running a microservices application that needs to handle variable load throughout the day. With EKS, you could:

1. Deploy your application using managed node groups
2. Set up the Cluster Autoscaler to automatically add or remove nodes based on demand
3. Use AWS Load Balancer Controller to automatically provision Application Load Balancers
4. Implement pod disruption budgets to ensure high availability during updates

Some things that make EKS particularly valuable for production workloads include the automated backup and restore capabilities, the ability to run multiple Kubernetes versions (useful for testing upgrades), and the option to use AWS Outposts for hybrid deployments.
