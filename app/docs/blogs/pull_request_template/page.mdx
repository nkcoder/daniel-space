## Pull Request Template

You can create a pull request template based on [Creating a pull request template for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) from Github:
- you can put it in the repository's root directory: `./pull_request_template.md`
- you can put it in the repository's `docs` directory: `./docs/pull_request_template.md`
- you can put it in a hidden directory: `./.github/pull_request_template.md`
- you can put multiple pull request templates in a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` subdirectory in the root director, `docs` directory, or `.github` hidden directory.

## Benefits

Pull request (PR) templates ensure consistency in PR descriptions, clarify expectations, improve code quality, and ultimately, streamline the review process. By providing a structured format, PR templates reduce back-and-forth communication and save time for both reviewers and contributors. 

- **Consistency:** PR templates standardize the information included in each PR, making it easier for reviewers to understand the changes and assess their impact. 
- **Clarity:**: They prompt contributors to provide essential details about their changes, including the problem being solved, the approach taken, and any testing steps. This reduces ambiguity and misunderstandings. 
- **Efficiency:** By providing a structured format, PR templates reduce the time spent on back-and-forth communication, allowing reviewers to focus on the actual code changes. 
- **Quality Control:** Templates can include checklists for testing, documentation updates, and other quality-related tasks, ensuring that contributors remember to address these aspects. 
- **Improved Documentation:** Detailed PR descriptions, guided by the template, serve as valuable documentation for the codebase, making it easier for future developers to understand the rationale behind changes.
