## Maccy

[Maccy](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy) is a lightweight clipboard manager for macOS. It keeps the history of what you copy and lets you quickly navigate, search, and use previous clipboard contents.

Features:

- Open source and free
- Keyboard-first
- Lightweight and fast
- Secure and private
- Options to `past automatically` and `paste without formatting`
- It can ignore applications like password managers

## Hammerspoon

[Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) is an open source tool for powerful automation of OS X. You can write Lua scripts to control many aspects of your OS X environment.

I mainly use it to configure global shortcuts for applications ([my config](https://github.com/nkcoder/dotfiles/tree/main/.hammerspoon)).

## Rectangle

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) is an open source tool to move and resize windows in macOS using keyboard shortcuts or snap areas.

If you have a big screen, this app is very helpful and easy to divide the screen into different parts. Most used shortcuts:

- Left Half/Right Half
- Top Half/Bottom Half
- Top Left/Top Right
- Bottom Left/Bottom Right

## NeoVim

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a powerful, highly customizable, and extensible text editor that is a fork of the popular Vim editor.

I'm using [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) for the setup, another popular setup is [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/).

## Terminal

### Alacritty

[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/index.html) is a fast, cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults. It's written with Zig and it's pretty fast.

The missing feature (for me, as of today 2025-08-09) is window split, but it's totally fine.

### Ghostty

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) is a fast, feature-rich and cross-platform terminal emulator that uses platform-native UI and GPU acceleration. It's written in Zig and it's very fast.

The missing feature (for me, as of today 2025-08-09) is the lack of a built-in `fine` or `search` function. There is an [open issue](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/189).
