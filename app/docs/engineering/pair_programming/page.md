# Pair Programming

When I was working in Thoughtworks, we have [Sensible Defaults](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-au/insights/topic/sensible-defaults) for software development. Sensible defaults are a set of principles and practices that are not intended to be "best practices", but rather a set of initial assumptions that we know to be effective and useful. Today I'm going to share one of these sensible defaults: **pair programming**.

## What is Pair Programming?

Pair programming is an agile software development practice where two developers collaborate in real time to solve a problem and produce code. The approach is based on continuous peer review and active collaboration.

Roles:

- Driver: Operates the keyboard/mouse, writes the code, and focuses on immediate implementation.
- Navigator: Observes, reviews, and guides at a higher level, considering design, architecture, and potential pitfalls.

üëâ Best practice: roles switch frequently (every 15‚Äì30 minutes) to maintain energy and ensure both developers contribute equally.

## Why Use Pair Programming?

Pair programming is used to address technical and organizational challenges:

- Knowledge Sharing & Onboarding: Helps junior developers ramp up quickly and spreads domain knowledge across the team.
- Improved Code Quality: Early bug detection and better design decisions due to continuous review.
- Reduced Knowledge Silos: Prevents expertise from being concentrated in a few people; improves team resilience (lowers ‚Äúbus factor‚Äù).
- Focus & Engagement: Accountability of working together reduces multitasking and distractions.
- Alignment with Agile/XP Principles: Reinforces collaboration, adaptability, and frequent feedback.

How to Implement Pair Programming

- Setup & Environment
  - Shared screen (dual monitors, or remote via tools like VS Code Live Share, JetBrains Code With Me).
  - Comfortable seating or virtual setup.
  - Equal access to keyboard/mouse when in person.
- Session Structure
  - Start with a quick design discussion (goals, approach, division of roles).
  - Switch roles regularly (every 15‚Äì30 minutes).
  - Break sessions every 60‚Äì90 minutes to avoid fatigue.
- Communication Practices
  - Navigator: verbalize reasoning, ask questions, and provide constructive feedback.
  - Driver: explain thought process while coding, remain open to suggestions.
- Team & Project Fit
  - Use selectively for complex features, tricky bugs, or critical components.
  - Less useful for routine, boilerplate, or research-heavy tasks.

## Pros

- Higher Code Quality: Continuous review reduces bugs and improves maintainability (research shows ~15‚Äì20% fewer defects).
- Knowledge Transfer: Accelerates skill growth and balances expertise across the team.
- Faster Problem Solving: Two brains solve complex problems more efficiently.
- Reduced Debugging Later: Issues are spotted immediately.
- Team Cohesion: Builds trust, shared standards, and better collaboration.
- Adaptability: Easier to onboard new team members or handle turnover.

## Cons

- Resource Intensity: Initially appears less efficient (2 developers on 1 task). ROI comes later via quality and fewer rework cycles.
- Personality Conflicts: Not all developers enjoy constant collaboration; mismatches can hinder productivity.
- Scheduling Complexity: Harder to align across time zones or different working hours.
- Not Universally Applicable: Some tasks (e.g., exploratory research, simple bug fixes) may not benefit.
- Mental Fatigue: Requires focus and social energy, which can be draining.

## Best Practices

- Voluntary Participation First: Avoid mandating pair programming; start with willing participants.
- Strategic Pairing:
- Senior‚Äìjunior for mentoring.
- Peer‚Äìpeer for solving complex problems.
- Rotate pairs regularly to avoid cliques and spread knowledge.
- Set Communication Norms: Encourage respect, patience, and curiosity.
- Timebox Sessions: Avoid overly long sessions; aim for 1‚Äì2 hours with breaks.
- Mix with Other Practices: Combine with code reviews, mob programming, and individual work for balance.
- Retrospectives: Regularly reflect on what worked/didn‚Äôt and adapt pairing practices.
